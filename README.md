# Assignment-2

In this project, we were assigned to create a single-page website, showcasing a fictional product or service.

##Goal:
The goal of the assignment is to make use of html and external css components to create a responsive, and design-forward website.

##Chosen Product:
For this project, we have chosen to sell the fictional product: the Firebolt, a broomstick from the Harry Potter series. 
In the series, this broomstick is the fastest one used by popular characters throughout the series. Our website aims to give an introduction to the product, and market it towards people who specifically know about the characters who use this product. 

##Design Rationale
The header of the website is bold, and engages the audience in. It is accompanied by a catchphrase, an image of the product and a simple design.
The color palette is specifically chosen to align with the themes of the series, as well as be neutral enough to stand out for a wide audience.
We then sroll to a side by side section of the popular characters that used the product. The pictures are highlighted to appeal to the audience that are familiar with the series.
Lastly, the form is created with complete simplicity to match the simplicity of the overall website.
